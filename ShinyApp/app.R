Under the Biden administration green energy solutions were pushed heavily and $7 billion dollars in grants were allocated through the Solar for All Grant to deliver residential solar energy to 900,000 households (EPA). Even further, the state of Virginia has been pushing towards carbon-neutrality and is working towards using 100% carbon free energy sources by 2050 (Virginia Department of Energy). Both of these efforts have led to an expansion in utility scale solar facility development, and in 2024 the state of Virginia created enough solar energy to power nearly 750,000 average households (Environment America).
