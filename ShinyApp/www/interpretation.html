<h4><strong>Interpretation of Results</strong></h4>
<p>The analysis of the parcel-level interaction model reveals how land values are affected by a parcel's specific location relative to new solar facilities and existing grid infrastructure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Increased Valuation of Grid Proximity Post-Construction:</strong> The model's primary finding is the statistically significant, negative coefficient (\(-0.139^*\)) on the \(\text{is\_post\_period} \times \log(\text{grid\_dist})\) interaction term. This result indicates that after a solar facility is commissioned, land parcels located farther from the electrical grid experience a relative decrease in value. Proximity to grid infrastructure appears to become a more capitalized asset in the land market post-construction.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Insignificant Impact of Solar Facility Proximity:</strong> Conversely, the interaction term between the distance to the solar facility and the post-construction period, \(\log(\text{sf\_dist}) \times \text{is\_post\_period}\), is not statistically significant. This suggests a lack of widespread evidence for a systematic price premium or penalty (i.e., an amenity or nuisance effect) that is dependent on a parcel's specific distance from the solar facility itself.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Model Validation through Control Variables:</strong> The model's control variables perform in a manner consistent with established land valuation principles. For example, land value per acre is negatively associated with parcel size (\(\text{Acres}\)) and distance from roads (\(\text{dist\_road\_miles}\)) and water (\(\text{dist\_water\_miles}\)). The statistical significance and expected direction of these controls increase confidence in the overall model specification.
